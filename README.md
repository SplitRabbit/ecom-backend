  ## Description
  🔍 This Project allows a user to view, create, update, and delete entries from an ecommerce backend using the sequelize package. It contains seed files for testing and also includes heroku syntax in the situation the user wants to deploy to heroku instead of hosting locally. Additionally, it uses the Mysql2 package along with the dotenv package to keep passwords secure.
